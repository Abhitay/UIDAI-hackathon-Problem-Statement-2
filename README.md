We are a team of 5, B.Tech 2nd year students, we developed did project for [AADHAAR HACKATHON 2021](https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in/).
### Theme 1: Address Update <br> [Problem Statement 2](https://hackathon.uidai.gov.in/problem-statement): Address Update Using Supporting Document. 

# Description:
We have made the application using Flutter as a mobile User-Interface framework.External(Fast Api,GeoCode) as well as Internal(Aadhaar eKYC API) api's have been used in the backend,they have been connected by using python as a programming language.Finally the backend data was deployed using Deta.

Step's:
(**The user will have to give permissions like camera and location**)

1.The operator will have to first enter their Aadhaar card number,which will generate an OTP,which will be sent to their linked mobile number.Once the user has been validated they will 
be redirected to the main screen.

2.Once the user has been redirected they will have to enter details like Street and District.

3.In the third step they will have to scan a offical document with the resendentail address like:-Electricity bill,with the help of a Optical Character Recognition(OCR) Scanner which has been provided in the application.

4.In the next step the operator will have to click on the validate button which will check the differance between the Original address and the address scanned using the OCR scanner, based on the input an corresponding output will be displayed on the  operator's screen.

5.If the address has been validated the user will have to click a picture of an offical document which was scanned using the OCR scanner for documentation purposes.
